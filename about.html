            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Toad Town Services is your trusted local partner for home repairs and technology support in Oneida County, Wisconsin. We understand that your home and technology should work for you, not against you.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in the Northwoods, I've always been the person friends and neighbors call when something needs fixing. Whether it's a squeaky door, a computer that won't start, or helping someone set up their new smartphone, I genuinely enjoy solving problems and helping people.</p>
            
            <p>After years of helping friends and family, I decided to turn my passion into a business to serve our entire community. I believe in honest work, fair prices, and taking the time to explain what I'm doing so you understand your home and technology better.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
            <p><strong>Local Knowledge:</strong> We know the unique challenges of living in northern Wisconsin - from older homes that need special care to helping folks stay connected with technology.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Patient Approach:</strong> Especially with technology support, we take the time to teach, not just fix. We want you to feel confident using your devices.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Honest Pricing:</strong> No hidden fees, no inflated charges. We provide clear estimates and explain all costs upfront.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reliable Service:</strong> When we say we'll be there, we show up. Your time is valuable, and we respect that.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Promise</h2>
            <p>Every job we take on - whether it's fixing a leaky faucet or helping you video call your grandchildren - gets our full attention. We're not happy until you're happy, and we stand behind all our work.</p>
            
            <p>We're proud to be part of the Oneida County community and look forward to helping you with whatever challenges come up around your home or with your technology.</p>
